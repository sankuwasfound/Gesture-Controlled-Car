First upload the Reciver code 
open the serial monitor at 115200 baud rate 
copy the MAC Address shown in the serial monitor
if nothing appears press the reset button on ESP32 
replace the MAC Code in the Transmitter 

THIS IS THE TRANSMITTER CODE WHERE MAC ADDRESS SHOULD BE REPLACED ( Line 8)
uint8_t receiverMac[] = { 0x00, 0x4B, 0x12, 0x2F, 0x0C, 0x64 };

EACH ESP32 HAS UNIQUE MAC CODE MAKE SURE YOU UPLOAD YOURS !!!!!
